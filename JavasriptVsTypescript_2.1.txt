Q1: What is TypeScript and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?

Typescript is free and open source programing language developed and maintened by Microsoft.
Why TypeScript?
To overcome problems with javascript which are below,
1) Objects are loosely structured meaning anyone can modify/add new property to the object.
eg var person = {'name': 'pardeep singh', 'age': 31}
person.address = 'Jammu';
2) No restrictions on calling the function with n number of argument 
eg. If i have defined one function sum(a,b); and while calling the sum function i can pass 1 to n 
number of arguments and function will work which eventually will produce unexpected results.
3)  No type safety meaning, I can have one variable declared and intalized with number and later on can assign
string value to it
eg. var a = 5;
a = 'Pardeep';
a = true;
4) We cannot define rules with the help of Tslint and eslint for code quality.

So to solve above problem statement we use Typescript.

Javascript vs Typescript

1) Typescript is a superset of Javascript ie TypeScript is nothing but JavaScript and some additional features
 i.e. ES6 features. It may not be supported in your target browser but TypeScript compiler can compile the .ts
 files into ES3,ES4 and ES5 also.
2) TypeScript always point out the compilation errors at the time of development only.
 Because of this at the run-time the chance of getting errors are very less whereas JavaScript
  is an interpreted language.
3) TypeScript has a feature which is strongly-typed or supports static typing.
 That means Static typing allows for checking type correctness at compile time.
  This is not available in JavaScript.
